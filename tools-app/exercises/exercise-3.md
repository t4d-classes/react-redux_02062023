# Exercise 3

1. Create a `CryptoTool` feature slice. Add a property named `coinName` to the feature slice's state.

2. Add a new action named `lookupCoinName`. The action should set the coin name from the action payload. Review the Stock Tool example.

3. Create a new selector to select the coin name from the state.

4. Update the `CryptoTool`'s `Card` component to utilize the `CryptoTool` feature state with the user entered coin name when the button is clicked.

5. Display a last updated time if you would like.

6. Ensure it works.
